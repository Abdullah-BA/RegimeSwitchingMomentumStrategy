## Coding Standards and Best Practices

- **Language & Style:**
  - **Language:** Python is the primary language.
  - **Style Guide:** Follow [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python code style.
    - Use clear, descriptive variable and function names.
    - Include docstrings and inline comments to explain the purpose and usage of modules, classes, and functions.
    - Organize imports in the following order: standard libraries, third-party libraries, then local modules.
  
- **Modularity:**
  - Write modular and reusable code. Each file or function should have a single responsibility.
  - Keep functions short and focused; split complex logic into helper functions in `utils.py`.

- **Version Control:**
  - Use Git for version control.
  - Write meaningful commit messages that describe the changes clearly.
  - Follow a branching strategy (e.g., feature branches, development branch, main/master branch) to manage code changes.

- **Testing & Documentation:**
  - Include tests where applicable (consider adding a `/tests` folder if the project grows).
  - Keep both inline code documentation and external documentation (in `/docs`) updated as code changes.
  - Use Jupyter notebooks in `/notebooks` for quick prototyping and visualization, ensuring that any important findings are documented in the main docs.

- **Code Reviews:**
  - Regularly perform code reviews to maintain code quality and ensure adherence to coding standards.
  - Encourage peer reviews to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing within the team.
