# Product Requirements Document (PRD) for Regime‑Switching Momentum Strategy

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for developing a Regime‑Switching Momentum Strategy that utilizes daily OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) stock data and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for detecting market regimes. The strategy is designed to generate momentum-based trading signals by dynamically adjusting to market conditions, thereby enhancing risk management and overall trading performance.

## 2. Objectives
- **Dynamic Regime Detection:** Implement a Hidden Markov Model to identify distinct market regimes (e.g., bullish, bearish, neutral) based on daily OHLCV data.
- **Momentum Signal Generation:** Develop a momentum trading strategy that adjusts its signals according to the detected regimes.
- **Robust Backtesting:** Provide a comprehensive backtesting framework to simulate historical performance and evaluate the strategy under various market conditions.
- **Integrated Risk Management:** Incorporate risk management protocols (e.g., stop-losses, position sizing) to mitigate potential drawdowns and adverse market impacts.
- **User-Centric Design:** Ensure the solution is accessible and valuable to quantitative traders, analysts, and researchers.

## 3. Target Users
- **Quantitative Traders:** Professionals looking for systematic trading strategies that leverage regime-based signals to enhance performance.
- **Financial Analysts:** Analysts who require robust backtesting and performance metrics to evaluate and refine trading strategies.
- **Research Teams:** Academics and industry researchers interested in exploring regime-switching models and momentum strategies.
- **Portfolio Managers:** Investment professionals seeking to integrate advanced trading signals into their risk-managed portfolios.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 Data Ingestion
- **Daily OHLCV Data Integration:**
  - Support ingestion of daily stock data (OHLCV) from multiple data providers.
  - Implement data validation, cleaning, and normalization processes.
  - Handle missing data, outliers, and corporate action adjustments.
- **Scalability:**
  - Ensure the system can scale to process large datasets efficiently.

### 4.2 Feature Engineering
- **Technical Indicator Calculation:**
  - Compute momentum indicators, moving averages, volatility measures, and other relevant features.
- **HMM-Specific Features:**
  - Engineer features (e.g., returns, scaled price changes, volatility metrics) tailored for effective HMM training.
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Normalize and scale features to ensure consistency and stability in model training.
  - Apply rolling window computations and time-series transformations as needed.

### 4.3 Regime Detection (Hidden Markov Model)
- **Model Implementation:**
  - Develop and implement a Hidden Markov Model to classify market regimes.
  - Configure parameters such as the number of states, transition probabilities, and emission distributions.
- **Model Training and Calibration:**
  - Train the HMM on historical data and perform periodic recalibration to adapt to evolving market dynamics.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Implement statistical measures (e.g., state separation quality, silhouette scores) to evaluate the effectiveness of regime classification.

### 4.4 Signal Generation
- **Trading Signal Logic:**
  - Generate buy, hold, and sell signals based on momentum indicators filtered through regime detection.
  - Define clear entry and exit rules that consider both momentum strength and current market regime.
- **Parameterization:**
  - Allow for adjustable thresholds and signal criteria to optimize strategy performance.
- **Integration:**
  - Seamlessly integrate signal generation with risk management and backtesting modules.

### 4.5 Backtesting Engine
- **Historical Simulation:**
  - Develop a robust backtesting framework that simulates strategy performance using historical OHLCV data.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Calculate key metrics such as annualized returns, Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdowns, and win/loss ratios.
- **Visualization and Reporting:**
  - Provide detailed visualizations (e.g., equity curves, regime plots, drawdown charts) and performance reports.
- **Walk-Forward Analysis:**
  - Support walk-forward testing to evaluate the strategy’s adaptability over time.

### 4.6 Risk Management
- **Risk Controls:**
  - Implement risk management protocols, including stop-loss rules, dynamic position sizing, and exposure limits.
- **Regime-Based Adjustments:**
  - Modify risk parameters based on detected regimes (e.g., reduce exposure during volatile or bearish regimes).
- **Monitoring and Alerts:**
  - Continuously monitor risk metrics and trigger alerts when predefined risk thresholds are breached.
- **Reporting:**
  - Generate risk management reports that provide insights into drawdowns, volatility, and overall risk exposure.

## 5. Assumptions & Constraints
- **Data Availability:** Only daily OHLCV data is available; intraday data will not be used.
- **Data Quality:** Assumes that the data from chosen sources is reliable, timely, and adjusted for corporate actions.
- **Market Focus:** The strategy is primarily designed for equity markets, though it may be adapted for other asset classes with modifications.
- **Computational Resources:** The complexity of HMM training and backtesting may require significant computational power.
- **Historical Data Length:** The effectiveness of regime detection may be constrained by the length and quality of historical data available.

## 6. Success Metrics
- **Sharpe Ratio:** Measure risk-adjusted returns to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy.
- **Maximum Drawdown:** Assess the worst-case peak-to-trough declines to monitor risk exposure.
- **Regime Separation Quality:** Evaluate the clarity and effectiveness of regime segmentation using statistical measures (e.g., silhouette scores).
- **Win/Loss Ratio:** Monitor the proportion of profitable trades versus losing trades.
- **Return on Investment (ROI):** Track overall profitability and growth of the trading strategy.
- **Backtest Performance Consistency:** Compare annualized returns, volatility, and other performance metrics over multiple historical periods.
- **User Satisfaction:** Gather feedback from quantitative traders, analysts, and researchers to ensure the tool meets their needs and expectations.

## 7. Additional Considerations
- **Documentation & Training:**
  - Provide comprehensive user manuals and training materials to facilitate onboarding.
- **Modular Architecture:**
  - Design the system with modular components to allow for easy updates and future enhancements.
- **Extensibility:**
  - Ensure the architecture supports integration with additional data sources, alternative models, and other asset classes.
- **Security & Compliance:**
  - Adhere to data security standards and regulatory requirements in data handling and strategy execution.
